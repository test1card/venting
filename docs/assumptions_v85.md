# Assumptions and limitations (v8.5)

- 0D lumped compartments.
- Ideal-gas air with constant `gamma`, `R`, `c_p`, `c_v`.
- Orifice model uses ideal isentropic relation with constant/effective `Cd`.
- Slot model is laminar viscous approximation.
- Model-form uncertainty remains in geometry and discharge coefficients.
